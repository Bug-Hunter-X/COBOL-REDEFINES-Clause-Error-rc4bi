01  WS-AREA-1 PIC X(100).
01  WS-AREA-2 REDEFINES WS-AREA-1.
    05 WS-SUB-AREA-1 PIC 9(5).
    05 WS-SUB-AREA-2 PIC X(95).

PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    MOVE 12345 TO WS-SUB-AREA-1
    DISPLAY WS-AREA-1
    DISPLAY WS-SUB-AREA-1
    STOP RUN. 

Note: The bug is subtle and might not be immediately apparent. The issue is that while MOVE 12345 to WS-SUB-AREA-1 works as expected, DISPLAY WS-AREA-1 might display unexpected characters in the remaining 95 bytes of WS-AREA-2 (depending on the compiler). The solution is to clearly understand and manage the data areas created through REDEFINES to avoid potential errors and unexpected output.
